Wrapper.py is an easy to use Minecraft server wrapper for adding extra functionality into the server without modifying
the Minecraft server jar. It comes with a relatively simple and straight-forward - yet powerful - plugin API that can be used
to create Bukkit-like plugins without any server modding.

# Quick Start #
### Stable branch
```
# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benbaptist/wrapper.py/master/requirements.txt

# Install stable Wrapper.py
pip3 install https://github.com/benbaptist/wrapper.py/archive/master.zip
```

### Development branch
```
# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benbaptist/wrapper.py/development/requirements.txt

# Install development (unstable) Wrapper.py
pip3 install https://github.com/benbaptist/wrapper.py/archive/development.zip
```

Just run `mcwrapper` in the working directory of your Minecraft server to start.
On first start, it'll present you with a setup wizard. After you complete, re-run `mcwrapper` again,
and enjoy.

You may need to adjust your shell's $PATH to incorporate your local bin folder, depending on your system or how you installed Wrapper. For some systems, adding this to your .bashrc may work:

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

Wrapper.py will automatically accept the Minecraft server EULA on your behalf, if you have not already done so.
