Just a place to jot down a general timeline of what I want to do with Wrapper for the short-term.

    - Ability to mark backup as important, to prevent it from auto-deletion
    - Multiple authors for plugins
    - Plugin dependencies

# 0.2
    - Automatic world rollback through dashboard
    - Modifying server.properties
    - Localize MaterializeCSS dependencies (don't use CDN)

# Before 1.0
